## biocore_documentation
Central repo for all non-project-specific documentation.  Includes biocore best practices and guidelines.
Contained within are walkthroughs on how to use this repository, and what our, (the MDIBL Biocore) expectations are for author(s).

#TODO update with a better description.

Since cloning Wikis is an option, the code section should remain mostly empty, save for license details and a README.
