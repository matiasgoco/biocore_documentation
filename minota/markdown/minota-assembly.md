# Introduction to De Novo Transcriptome Assembly

Welcome back to the MDIBL MINOTA Workshop! Today we're going to be discussing De Novo Transcriptome Assembly. We'll start by a brief introduction to the rationale behind assembly, followed by a review of some tools that are commonly implemented.

We'll be focusing primarily on Trinity, the main assembler for this course; delving into how it functions, and its algorithmic processes. Included will be a brief review of the importance of pre-processing your data before assembly, as well as some utilities that come built into the software package.
