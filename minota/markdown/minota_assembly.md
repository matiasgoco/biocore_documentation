# Introduction to De Novo Transcriptome Assembly
(Slide 1 + 2)

Welcome back to the MDIBL MINOTA Workshop! Today we're going to be discussing De Novo Transcriptome Assembly. We'll start by a brief introduction to the rationale behind assembly, followed by a review of some tools that are used to do the work.

We'll then focus on Trinity, the primary assembler for this course; delving into how it functions, it's algorithmic processes, and some interesting baked-in features. Included will be a brief review of the importance of pre-processing your data before assembly.
